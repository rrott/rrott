Hello, my name is Roman Rott!
I'm a Full-Stack Ruby developer with a strong interest in ethical hacking, penetration testing and vulnerability analysis. I have 15 years of IT experience and 8 years experience dedicated to web-development.

Ruby is my favorite when it comes to following TDD and OOP best practices, while EcmaScript and TypeScript are the best one for front-end.
